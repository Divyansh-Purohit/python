This is an automated python project to generate the result of students. These scripts just require an input file in csv form containing the marks if the students and generates different types of performance graphs of each student along with detailed statistic report of all the students.

These programs are designed to run from command line and any possible errors that might occur due to wrong user input gets logged in a seperate log file.

The file 101903438.py contains the code to implement topsis for the given input file 101903438.csv
